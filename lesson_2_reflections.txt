What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created in the folder.
You need to do it because it will make the file into a git repository
that can track your commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?

 The staging area tracks what files you want to be included in the 
 commit.  Since you may have changed many files and want to keep each
  commit as a single logical change then you can pick and choose what
  files get commited.
